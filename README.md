# ActionBar_DRs
A World of Warcraft **Retail** AddOn that tracks diminishing returns on crowd control and displays their state on applicable buttons in the form of a customizable border. Works in both PvP and PvE, though keep in mind some mobs do not have Diminishing Returns on some CC categories.
## Compatibility
This AddOn works with the default Blizzard buttons, ElvUI, as well as Bartender4.
## Download
TBD - for now you can just download this repository and paste it into `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\`
## Contributing guidelines
Any fixes, feature suggestions, bug reports are welcome!
